			<p>Our first demo of \'Rover\' remote driving was in late 2007 for a spot to appear on CNBC TV in late Dec.
</p><p>After some online searching we found the SRV-1 from Surveyor Corp in San Luis Obispo, CA.
</p>

Note: You may have trouble playing either or both of these since they are in older formats.  I will try to load a copy we have on CD to this site soon.
</p><p>We decided to buy an SRV-1 but the company was out of production.  They did give us the name of the last person to buy one and it happened he was at Univ of Mich (my alma mater).  We called Kevin and he agreed to let us use his SRV-1 for the demo.  He and his wife even set up a "lunar landscape"  in their kitchen.  CNBC sent a crew to film it in Michigan while Fred and reporter Jane \'drove\' the SRV-1 from California.  All the necessary software came with the SRV-1.

<p>Since we could not buy an SRV-1, we decided to purchase a Lego Mindstorm kit since I had some experience with Lego Robotics and wanted an excuse to play with the new NXT kit&nbsp;:-)  I wanted to use it as a \'mule\' for software development of our own \'remote driving\' package.  I managed to put together off-the-shelf hardware and software that gave me a local driving demo,
but not one that worked remotely over the net.  
<br />
Below is a list of the pieces used:
<br />
hardware:<br />
</p>
<ul><li> Mindstorm kit parts <br />
</li><li> Philips SPC900NC USB Camera (is used by astronomers and has both Windoze and Linux drivers)
</li><li> Linksys USBBT100 BT adapter (uses same chip as the Mindstorm so should be software compatible)
</li><li> Mini GearCam (BVGM-1) at <a href="http://www.boostervision.com" class="external free" title="http://www.boostervision.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.boostervision.com</a>
</li><li> Easy CAP WS-U20CAP USB 2.0 Video Capture Box
</li></ul>
<p><b>Note</b>: Eventually gave up on the LinkSys USB Bluetooth and bought the Mindstorm part
9847 Bluetooth® Dongle.  It worked much better with my computer and the NXT controller software:
</p>
<ul><li> Mindstorm kit s/w <br />
</li><li> Opensource VLC ( <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/streaming.html" class="external free" title="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/streaming.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/streaming.html</a> )
</li></ul>

Here is a status report I posted to our Team Forum at the time:

<p><b>NXT Bot Progress</b>
by rich&nbsp;» Sun Dec 09, 2007 6:22 pm<br />
Re: TFxBot <br />
I have been driving the NXT around my apt the past hour, lots of fun!... <br />
right now the cam is fixed and maybe too high on the bot... <br />
it is hard to judge distance and I keep running into things... <br />
and catching the wheels since they stick out on the sides... <br />
not enough peripheral vision I think... <br />
<br />
also the Bluetooth range is disappointing...<br />
it might be interference with the cam radio... <br />
they both are using 2.4GHz range I think... <br />
also seeing some interference bars on the video... <br />
the camera was really clear and the radio handled 50 ft no problem <br />
when I tested it at the office into a large flat screen <br />
so we can probably figure it out and still use the NXT for practice driving. <br />
On my Vista platform... <br />
I am using VLC Media Player to show the bot video... <br />
and Anders NXT Remote to drive the bot... <br />

I have the source so I should be able to add adjustable delay. <br />
If I get stuck I\'ll need some help from someone. <br />
<br />
Now we just need to figure out how to do this from a remote site. <br />
And to add a joystick to the remote driving client (a request from our Feerless Leader&nbsp;:-)<br />

This is where I left this effort to help with other needs of the Team. <br />
</p><p>Here you can see the NXT Bot with the wireless camera mounted and some LED headlights I thought might help with better video from the camera while driving around my apartment.  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/rich911rt/NXTBot?feat=directlink" class="external autonumber" title="http://picasaweb.google.com/rich911rt/NXTBot?feat=directlink" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>
