<p><b>The Lunar mission present by Frednet</b>
</p><p>We\'re in the process of putting a new proto-typing experiment together to leverage interest in educational outreach. A wiki page is forming to describe the project - but it concerns creating \'mindstorms\' models of our three rover concepts and flowing down to the community the operations software for remote control. We are working on the description of tasks for this so it will have a strong resemblance to what we\'ll need for the actual system. The intent is to start proto-typing the technologies to demonstrate open source hardware development and team interactions.
What I think we should do is something which demonstrates:
</p>
<ol><li> A successful open source development model - teams working together do develop working designs that are distributed to the community
</li><li> A demonstration of remote operations - participants can use our rover software to control vehicles either locally or remotely
</li><li> Promotion of the team - we need more to establish our open source brand
</li><li> Leverage google efforts - we should stay ahead of Google opportunities 
</li></ol>
