Lego Mindstorms

Purpose

To develop an educational forum where students can experience robotics and remote operations in a collaborative open source environment.

Check out the LEGO Moonbots competition. If you are student group, you should consider joining.

If you are interested in joining the Team FREDNET LEGO effort, drop me an e-mail at lego-users AT teamfrednet DOT org. We are working on making an open source package to remotely operate LEGO style rovers (and other rovers). This should parlay into the system we eventually use with our mission.

Programmers and hardware developers wanted.

Better yet if you've got your own MINDSTORMS kit to demo the software architecture.
